                    ********* ðŸ“ŒExplanation of Code ********

How This Works-----------------
1. When a user logs out, their JWT is stored in this collection.
2. Before authenticating any request, the system checks if the token is in the blacklist.
3. If the token is blacklisted, access is denied (401 Unauthorized).
4. After 24 hours, the blacklisted token is automatically deleted by MongoDB.

 Why Use a Token Blacklist?++++++++++++++++++
1. Enhances security by preventing JWT reuse after logout.
2. Supports manual token revocation (e.g., force logout for security reasons).
3. Automatically clears expired tokens, reducing database clutter.
4. This is a great way to secure user authentication in a JWT-based system!
